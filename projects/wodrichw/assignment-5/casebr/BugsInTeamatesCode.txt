Bug: The appointments in a cal day object are not sorted correctly
Cause: The insertion sort of a new appointment starts at index 1 instead of index 0 in the appointment array.
Reproduce: This bug can be reproduced by creating two appointments of the same day and different start hours.
						One of the appointments starts at a later time than the other. Add the later appointment to a  
						cal day first and then the earlier second. When you test that the appoitments are sorted in the
						cal day, you find that the later one actually starts first.
Replicated by:	
		cal = new CalDay(today)
		Appt appt = new Appt(startHour,
		          startMinute ,
		          startDay ,
		          startMonth ,
		          startYear ,
		          title,
						 description);
		cal.addAppt(appt);
		appt =  new Appt((startHour - 3),
		          startMinute ,
		          startDay ,
		          startMonth ,
		          startYear ,
		          title,
						 description);
		cal.addAppt(appt);

Severity: No other methods rely on the calander day to have a sorted list of appointments, I would say this
					is low severity.

Priority: Since, the correct assortment of appointments in a calander day is relatively critical to the usability of the
					program, I would say this has a medium priority.
